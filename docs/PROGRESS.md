# Progress

## Current status
- Markdown documentation has been centralized under `docs/`.
- The next-gen volume pipeline refactor program under `docs/refactor-nextgen-volume/` is complete for the currently scoped backlog (Phases 0-6).
- vNext preprocessed schema implementation is complete (strict format + multiscale descriptors + spatial chunk writes/reads).
- The major refactor program is complete and archived in `docs/refactor/ARCHIVE_SUMMARY.md`.
- The app has local verification gates for fast checks, UI/browser checks, and full/nightly runs.
- Viewer, route, VR, and preprocessing hotspots have been decomposed into smaller modules to reduce coupling.

## Most recent high-signal updates
- Improved preprocessing throughput on the main ingest path:
  - 3D/2D file decoding now runs in bounded batches with next-batch prefetch to reduce one-file-at-a-time worker startup overhead in `preprocess.ts`
  - chunk writes now use a bounded in-flight write queue (instead of hard per-chunk write serialization)
  - per-scale histogram generation is now fused with chunk-stat scanning during chunk emission (removes an extra full-volume pass)
  - segmentation label downsampling now avoids per-voxel `Map` allocations by using fixed-size local candidate arrays
  - OPFS/directory storage backends now cache directory handles for read/write path reuse
  - front-page preprocessing now enables shard-backed write mode by default (`storageStrategy.sharding.enabled=true`)
- Landed true 3D brick-residency cutover (`NGR-080/081/082`):
  - provider now exposes `getBrickAtlas` / `hasBrickAtlas` / `prefetchBrickAtlases` and builds atlas payloads directly from chunk reads (sharded + non-sharded)
  - route/playback prefetch/readiness in 3D mode now uses brick-atlas residency instead of full-volume cache residency
  - viewer 3D path now supports atlas-only layers (`volume === null`) without requiring full-volume `u_data` uploads
  - added/updated coverage in:
    - `tests/preprocessedDataset.test.ts`
    - `tests/app/hooks/useRouteLayerVolumes.test.ts`
    - `tests/app/hooks/useRoutePlaybackPrefetch.test.ts`
    - `tests/useVolumeResources.test.ts`
  - provider cache hardening completed (`NGR-083`): brick page-table/atlas caches now use bounded LRU eviction tied to `setMaxCachedVolumes(...)`
  - provider atlas build throughput improved (`NGR-084`): brick-atlas chunk plans now execute in bounded parallel workers
  - mixed layer residency hardening completed (`NGR-085`): route/playback now split atlas+volume backend usage per-layer to preserve segmentation/slice correctness
  - refreshed benchmark report in `docs/refactor-nextgen-volume/BASELINE_REPORT.json` (2/2 matrix cases passing):
    - `tier-a-single-channel`: generation 27.89 ms, cold 31.12 ms, warm 18.98 ms, mixed 19.22 ms
    - `tier-a-multichannel`: generation 80.36 ms, cold 48.06 ms, warm 46.54 ms, mixed 46.70 ms

  - Backward compatibility is not required while the project is in early development.
- Updated `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to reference the relocated documentation files.

## Major completed milestones (condensed)
- Route orchestration split into focused hooks (`useRoute*` modules) to reduce monolithic app routing state.
- `ViewerShell` orchestration split into recording, panel-window, and paintbrush integration hooks.
- `VolumeViewer` and planar-viewer supporting logic split into lifecycle/rendering/helper modules.
- VR controller/HUD hotspot logic split across focused modules (controller lifecycle/select handlers, HUD sections, ray updater helpers).
- Preprocessing pipeline reorganized into explicit staged helpers for manifest creation, metadata collection, and timepoint writes.
- Local test and verification workflow expanded (frontend tests, visual checks, Playwright smoke/visual/nightly scenarios, perf checks).

## Active follow-up TODOs
- Keep the refactor status synchronized between `BACKLOG.md`, `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and `EXECUTION_LOG.md`.
- Keep `docs/README.md` and any contributor tooling aligned with the new docs-only Markdown layout.
- Continue monitoring large orchestration files and split further when cohesion degrades.
- Add or maintain focused tests for import/export edge cases and high-risk viewer/VR interaction paths.

## Verification commands
- Fast gate: `npm run verify:fast`
- UI/browser gate: `npm run verify:ui`
- Full gate: `npm run verify:full`
- Nightly local gate: `npm run verify:nightly`
